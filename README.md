# :fire: flamebase-database-server-cluster
Server cluster to hold a realtime JSON database.

### What is this?
Flamebase is an open source project that tries to emulate Firebase Database features as much as possible. I like Firebase but it's expensive for what it currently offers.
If you are doing an altruist project with Firebase, pray not to became successful, because the monthly amount will increase considerably.

In this repo you can find the proper package for run a server cluster with node framework.
For now it still developing, so please be patient with errors.

### Setup

Install package:
```bash
 flamebase-database-server-cluster --save
```

Create a server cluster to hold all realtime changes.

```javascript
var FlamebaseDatabaseCluster = require('flamebase-database-server-cluster');

var FSC = new FlamebaseDatabaseCluster("draco", 1507);
FSC.initCluster({
    start: function () {
        console.log("start!!")
    }
}, null);
```
Alternatively you can start the server cluster by cloning this repo and launch on terminal:
```bash
node launcher.js 
```
Console Output:
```bash
start!!
